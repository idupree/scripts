This is a collection of scripts I've made over the years for personal use.

Some (like lntree or fork) I find useful on their own; some (like superchroot)
might sometimes be useful or might be better reserved for use as a reference
example.

Portability note: I use Linux.  If these scripts break on e.g. OS X, BSD
or MinGW, I'd love if you tell me and/or submit a patch!  I try to write
portably except when GNU features make code much easier. (I've since estimated
that if it wants such features, it probably makes sense for me to rewrite the
script in Python).
